# TODO

* improvement: re-visit nodes booting from a disk image rather than CD-ROM
* improvement: allow for customization of nodes (CPU, RAM, etc.)
* improvement: allow for injection of addition configuration patches
* improvement: allow for introducing pre-existing Talos nodes into the cluster
* refactor: encapsulate node creation into a submodule (DRY)
* refactor: find a "cleaner" way to handle node reboot race conditions
